# alexaNaim

** Warning this code is under active development does not work yet **

An experiment in building a server that announces itself using UPnP to
Amazon's Alexa and can be used to adjust the volume on Naim mu-so.

Amazon documentation seems to require that all skills are added via
the cloud. This is an attempt to configure everything locally. Some
devices such as the Philips Hue can still be controlled locally.

At the time of writing the protocol between the Naim phone app and the
Naim mu-so has not been examined. A request for information from Naim
was denied. If the communication is encrypted then it will not be
possible to reverse engineer.
